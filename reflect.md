# Reflection

- My game is completely event driven rather than having an actual loop that runs, which is a first for me.
- I learned the specifics of how to write algorithms that generate chess moves for all the pieces. The pawn moves and king moves are especially complex, with many cases that need to be considered.
- I used custom higher order functions for the first time in JavaScript, specifically for separating my backend logic from my UI logic.
- The scope was quite large, and the complexity was high, and that resulted in a lot of code which was a challenge.
- I managed the complexity by focussing on manageable chunks - for example I implemented the UI interactivity first before implementing the chess logic.
- The final product closely follows my initial design - they were both event driven, and I used almost all the functions from my initial skeleton. My final product had a bunch more helper functions than were initially outlined, but they all worked towards the same overall goal that was initially outlined.
- I did not use AI to write my code, as I felt I did not need to. I didn't see any point in using AI to help as I already had an outline and skeleton, which is what I feel like AI is best used for. It is not very good at detailed implementations, and often spits out buggy code that needs to be reworked anyways. I also felt it would be more fun to implement my own solution without help from AI.
